                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <p>Well-documented use-cases are important for testing works-in-progress. But semi-automatic process can only go so far. Still the process should be semi-labor-intensive, as it requires the user to configure the collection process. Note that this process currently works on modern English (and not Proto-Indo-European languages). Here's another triple hyphenated word: non-government-owned corporations. Thanks Wikipedia! Let's try this word from the Keats project: death-warrant. But neither of these made up words should work: scooble-scandor.</p>
