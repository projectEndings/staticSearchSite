        <p>Foreign languages can appear often through out texts, where <span lang="fr">le mot</span> will never be in the dictionary. This could be <span lang="ja">面倒くさい</span> for some implementers, but we should handle it gracefully. But made up words--or missspelled ones--should still
            end up in the foreign word list.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>Beyond A-Z</h2>
            <p>Our <span lang="en">stemmer</span> has to handle constructs like:</p>
            <blockquote>
                MY Worthy Lord, theſe
                preſentmentes which
                were intẽded principally
                for your Honor, and for
                Illuſtrating the worth of
                that worthy Corporatiõ
                (whereof you are a Member) come now
                humbly to kiſſe your Lordſhips handes;
                and to preſent the Inuentor of them to that
                ſeruice, which (my ability expreſt in this)
                may call me to (vnder your Lordſhips
            </blockquote>
            <p>But not constructs for elements like &lt;blockquote&gt; or this &amp; that.</p>
