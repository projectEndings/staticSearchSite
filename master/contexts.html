                <h3>Block Quotation</h3>
                <p>This part of the document contains blockquotes.</p>
                <p>In any instance, we want the block-quotation to be the primary part of the search context. Let's take this paragraph from the Unicode <cite>UNICODE TEXT SEGMENTATION</cite> standard:</p>
                <blockquote>The correct interpretation of hyphens in the context of word boundaries is challenging. It is quite common for separate words to be connected with a hyphen: “out-of-the-box,” “under-the-table,” “Italian-American,” and so on. A significant number are hyphenated names, such as “Smith-Hawkins.” When doing a Whole Word Search or query, users <span>expect</span> to find the word within those hyphens. <span>While</span> there are some cases where they are separate words (usually to resolve some ambiguity such as “re-sort” as opposed to “resort”), it is better overall to keep the hyphen out of the default definition. Hyphens include U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+2010 HYPHEN, possibly also U+058A ARMENIAN HYPHEN, and U+30A0 KATAKANA-HIRAGANA DOUBLE HYPHEN.</blockquote>

                <h3>Editorial Notes context test</h3>
                <p>There are many instances of so-called <q>inline quotations</q> that should not be treated as context bits. Note here that arbitrary <span>span elements</span> will not be processed.<br/>
                That's a break in a paragraph, which <span>should</span> also be ignored in processing. Even possible frag<wbr/>ments of words should be ignored.</p>
                <p>But if, for some reason, you think a note, for instance, should be processed as a definable bit then it will be so. <span class="ed_note">Editorial notes, for instance, which we will float to the side, should have their own context.</span> This means that editorial notes will be ignored from the other processing, too, for context, methinks.</p>

                <h3>Overrides Context Test</h3>
            <div class="para">Now let's say you use <code>div</code> elements instead of paragraphs, but you also use divs for editorial notes.<div class="ed_note">Creating editorial notes as divs might have advantanges, but it might also be superfluous.</div> But we one might also use divs as an <div class="not_context" style="display:inline">inline element</div>, which certainly isn't advisable.</div>
